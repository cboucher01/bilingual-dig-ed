## Introduction

doggEd is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme based on [Ed](http://minicomp.github.io/ed) 
and inspired by [*Encyclopedia of the Dog*](encyclopediaofthedog.com). It is designed for minimal bilingual editions and allow readers to view texts in both languages side-by-side or either one by itself. Its simple, unobtrusive menu enables users to easily configure the settings to their liking.

Like Ed, doggEd was created with [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) 
principles in mind.


## Current Features

- Templates for narrative, drama and poetry
- Responsive design for mobile phones, tablets and PCs.
- Relatively easy to learn and teach
- Works well in high- or low- bandwidth scenarios
- Easier for digital archives and libraries to preserve
- Open source, open access
- Unobtrusive footnotes
- Metadata in Dublin Core and OpenGraph to play nice with Zotero, libraries and social media.
- Automatic table of content generation
- Simple search functionality
- Annotations via [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/)
- Optional: Ability to generate well-formatted bibliographies and linked citations


## Installing and using doggEd

The instructions for getting started with doggEd are the same as
for Ed. Please visit the Ed [documentation page](http://minicomp.github.io/ed/documentation),
for information on how to install and use the template.

This repository will be updated with doggEd-specific instructions
at a later time.
