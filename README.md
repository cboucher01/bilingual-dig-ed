## Introduction

doggEd is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme based on [Ed](http://minicomp.github.io/ed) 
and inspired by [*Encyclopedia of the Dog*](encyclopediaofthedog.com). It is designed for minimal bilingual editions and allow readers to view texts in both languages side-by-side or either one by itself. Its simple, unobtrusive menu enables users to easily configure the settings to their liking.

Like Ed, doggEd was created with [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) 
principles in mind.
